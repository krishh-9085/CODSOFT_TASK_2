# **CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION**

This repository contains code and resources for predicting customer churn. 
## **Project Overview**
Customer churn is a major problem for businesses. It can be costly to acquire new customers, so it's important to retain existing ones. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict which customers are likely to churn.
## **Data**
The data used in this project is a dataset of customer churn. The dataset contains information about customer demographics, account activity, and other factors that may be related to churn.
## **Model**
The model used in this project is a [LOGISTIC REGRESSION, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, GRADIENT BOOSTING MODEL ]. 
## **Results**
These models achieved a [86%]. This indicates that the model is able to accurately predict churn.
## **Future Work**
Future work on this project could include:* Exploring other machine learning models* Improving the feature engineering process* Developing a real-time churn prediction system
## **Getting Started**
To get started with this project, you will need to:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the code.
