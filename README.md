<p id="description">Customer churn is a major problem for businesses. It can be costly to acquire new customers so it's important to retain existing ones. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict which customers are likely to churn. The data used in this project is a dataset of customer churn. The dataset contains information about customer demographics account activity and other factors that may be related to churn. The model used in this project is a [LOGISTIC REGRESSION SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE GRADIENT BOOSTING MODEL ].</p>
